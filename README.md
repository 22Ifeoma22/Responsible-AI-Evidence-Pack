\# Responsible-AI-Evidence-Pack

![RAI Monitoring](https://github.com/22Ifeoma22/Responsible-AI-Evidence-Pack/actions/workflows/monitoring.yml/badge.svg)


A hands-on demo of \*\*Responsible AI\*\* auditing for a tabular ML model (OpenML Adult).  

It trains a model, runs a \*\*fairness audit\*\* (by sex), generates an \*\*explainability\*\* plot (fast SHAP / permutation fallback),

and writes a \*\*governance audit trail\*\*. Aligned to \*\*NIST AI RMF (Map-Measure-Manage-Govern + Monitor)\*\* and \*\*ISO/IEC 42001\*\* (AI management system).
